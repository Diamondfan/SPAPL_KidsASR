    r"""This computes a VTLN warping function that is not the same as HTK's one,
    but has similar inputs (this function has the advantage of never producing
    empty bins).

    This function computes a warp function F(freq), defined between low_freq
    and high_freq inclusive, with the following properties:
        F(low_freq) == low_freq
        F(high_freq) == high_freq
    The function is continuous and piecewise linear with two inflection
        points.
    The lower inflection point (measured in terms of the unwarped
        frequency) is at frequency l, determined as described below.
    The higher inflection point is at a frequency h, determined as
        described below.
    If l <= f <= h, then F(f) = f/vtln_warp_factor.
    If the higher inflection point (measured in terms of the unwarped
        frequency) is at h, then max(h, F(h)) == vtln_high_cutoff.

    Creates a frequency bin conversion matrix used to obtain a mel spectrogram. This is called a *mel filter bank*, and
    various implementation exist, which differ in the number of filters, the shape of the filters, the way the filters
    are spaced, the bandwidth of the filters, and the manner in which the spectrum is warped. The goal of these
    features is to approximate the non-linear human perception of the variation in pitch with respect to the frequency.

    Different banks of mel filters were introduced in the literature. The following variations are supported:

    - MFCC FB-20: introduced in 1980 by Davis and Mermelstein, it assumes a sampling frequency of 10 kHz and a speech
      bandwidth of `[0, 4600]` Hz.
    - MFCC FB-24 HTK: from the Cambridge HMM Toolkit (HTK) (1995) uses a filter bank of 24 filters for a speech
      bandwidth of `[0, 8000]` Hz. This assumes sampling rate â‰¥ 16 kHz.
    - MFCC FB-40: from the Auditory Toolbox for MATLAB written by Slaney in 1998, assumes a sampling rate of 16 kHz and
      speech bandwidth of `[133, 6854]` Hz. This version also includes area normalization.
    - HFCC-E FB-29 (Human Factor Cepstral Coefficients) of Skowronski and Harris (2004), assumes a sampling rate of
      12.5 kHz and speech bandwidth of `[0, 6250]` Hz.

    This code is adapted from *torchaudio* and *librosa*. Note that the default parameters of torchaudio's
    `melscale_fbanks` implement the `"htk"` filters while librosa uses the `"slaney"` implementation.

    Args:
        num_frequency_bins (`int`):
            Number of frequencies used to compute the spectrogram (should be the same as in `stft`).
        num_mel_filters (`int`):
            Number of mel filters to generate.
        min_frequency (`float`):
            Lowest frequency of interest in Hz.
        max_frequency (`float`):
            Highest frequency of interest in Hz. This should not exceed `sampling_rate / 2`.
        sampling_rate (`int`):
            Sample rate of the audio waveform.
        norm (`str`, *optional*):
            If `"slaney"`, divide the triangular mel weights by the width of the mel band (area normalization).
        mel_scale (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"htk"`):
            The mel frequency scale to use, `"htk"`, `"kaldi"` or `"slaney"`.
        triangularize_in_mel_space (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            If this option is enabled, the triangular filter is applied in mel space rather than frequency space. This
            should be set to `true` in order to get the same results as `torchaudio` when computing mel filters.

    Returns:
        `np.ndarray` of shape (`num_frequency_bins`, `num_mel_filters`): Triangular filter bank matrix. This is a
        projection matrix to go from a spectrogram to a mel spectrogram.
